## Introduction 

Since I was a little kid, I’ve always had a fascination for airports and airplanes. I remember wanting to stay at the airports all day long and just watch the airplanes whenever we were dropping someone off or I was going on a trip myself. It wasn’t just the planes taking off which fascinated me, it was also the small things like watching the luggage/cargo being loaded onto the plane, seeing the pilots and flight attendants walking around the airport, and watching the planes arrive at and depart from the terminal gates. I haven’t even mentioned my curiosity of how these enormous things are made and how they’re able to fly so safely several thousand feet above the ground with hundreds of passengers onboard. Now, it’s probably easy to see why I was excited to work on this project. 

## Problem Statement 

Maven Airlines, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is displeased to find that over 50% of their passengers are not satisfied with the airline overall, according to the latest customer satisfaction survey. In order to prevent losing a part of their customer base, leadership has brought me in as a Data Analyst to identify where things might be going wrong and to help provide a data-driven strategy which will bring those satisfaction levels back up. I’ve been given the option to present my findings in the form of a single-page report or dashboard. 

## Data-Driven Strategy 

By analyzing the company's raw data from several different angles using SQL, it is recommended that Maven Airlines should focus on the following two areas in order to improve overall passenger satisfaction: **In-flight WiFi Service** and **Ease of Online Booking**. Out of a total 14 factors which were reviewed, both ranked in the Bottom 3 average satisfaction scores on a scale of 1 to 5. Additionally, both Economy and Business Class passengers, who comprise over 90% of the total respondents in the survey, were most displeased with these services as a large portion of them rated these services a score of 1. 

A possible solution for the WiFi inconvenience passengers are facing would be to install a new system in the aircraft, if budget permits, or improve the reliability of the current one. For those having a hard time using the Online Booking services to purchase tickets or find information, ensure the Maven Airlines travel site is easy to navigate, responsive, and catered with the end-user in mind by implementing new and improved UI/UX features for both mobile and desktop platforms to make Online Booking a seamless experience for passengers.
